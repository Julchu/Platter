Feature suggestions:

"how orders behave across restaurants, like if you start a cart at one restaurant then go look at another restaurant and try to add something what happens? Does it save your cart from the past restaurant and start a new one, does it scrap the old one and start a new one?
Probably shouldn't be able to mix between restaurants unless maybe you can but i dont' think most apps do that

"uh customers being able to search for restaurants and maybe ordering them based on location closest
and like searching for a type of food and getting restaurants back, so like maybe restaurants have tags so they show up in these searches"
